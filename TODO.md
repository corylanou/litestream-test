# Litestream LTX TODO List

Based on feedback from Ben Johnson on July 30, 2025.

## High Priority Fixes

### 1. [x] Fix Command-line Replication Default Interval Bug ([#669](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/669))

**Issue**: Command-line replication without config file causes continuous snapshots instead of using 24h default interval  
**Details**: When using `litestream replicate db.db s3://bucket/path` without a config file, snapshot interval defaults to 0s causing continuous snapshots  
**Expected**: Should use 24h default snapshot interval  
**Status**: âœ… MERGED - [PR #678](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/pull/678)

### 2. [x] Fix Compaction File Handling Errors ([#670](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/670))

**Issue**: Occasional "no such file or directory" errors during snapshot compaction  
**Details**: Temporary file handling issues during compaction at level 9  
**Note**: Data integrity is not affected, but the errors should be resolved  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ OPEN - [PR #679](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/pull/679)

## Command Updates

### 3. [x] Rename `litestream wal` command to `litestream ltx` ([#671](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/671))

**Task**: Update the command name from `wal` to `ltx` to better reflect that it's now listing LTX files  
**Files to update**:

- Command registration
- Help text
- Documentation
- Examples

**Status**: ðŸ”„ OPEN - [PR #680](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/pull/680)

### 4. [x] Fix TXID Display Formatting ([#672](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/672))

**Issue**: TXID values are not displaying in proper hex format  
**Task**: Update all CLI commands to display TXID as `ltx.TXID.String()` which formats as `%016x`  
**Current**: Shows as decimal `30303030303030303030303030303032`  
**Expected**: Should show as hex like `0000000000000002`  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ OPEN - [PR #681](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/pull/681)

### 5. [x] Fix TXID Parsing for CLI Arguments ([#673](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/673))

**Task**: Find all places accepting TXID as CLI arguments and ensure using `ltx.ParseTXID` function  
**Note**: This ensures consistent TXID format handling across all commands  
**Status**: âœ… VERIFIED - [PR #682](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/pull/682) (adds tests confirming correct implementation)

## Infrastructure Updates

### 6. [x] Upgrade AWS S3 Client from v1 to v2 ([#674](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/674))

**Current**: Using v1 of AWS S3 SDK  
**Task**: Upgrade to AWS SDK Go v2 for S3 operations  
**Benefits**: Better performance, updated features, ongoing support  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ OPEN - PR #682 (ready for review)

### 7. [ ] Add S3 Performance Benchmarks

**Task**: Create benchmarks to measure S3 client performance improvements from AWS SDK v2 migration  
**Benchmarks to add**:

- Upload performance (various file sizes)
- Download performance
- List operations pagination
- Concurrent operations
- Memory usage profiling

**Note**: Compare v1 (from git history) vs v2 implementation to quantify improvements

## Community Contributions

### 8. [ ] Review and Address GitHub Issues ([#675](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/675))

**Task**: Go through open GitHub issues and find low-hanging fruit to address
